**Melt the bittersweet chocolate and butter and 1/4 cup rum in a heatproof bowl in the microwave (in 30 sec bursts) till nice and smooth. Let it cool slightly.**

*In a food processor, process the cookies, coconut and cocoa powder and sugar till it's completely crushed and is in fine crumbs.*

**Add the melted chocolate and butter mix, to the cookie base while running the food processor until it's mixed through. Scrape the sides in between to ensure that it mixes evenly.**

*Add the remaining rum and mix it through until you get a slightly sticky ball of "dough".*

**Place the truffle "dough" in a bowl and knead for a few seconds until completely mixed through, and smooth.Let the dough rest and cool down. It should become less sticky and less soft but still fudgy.**

*Make 1 - 1 1/2 inch balls from the dough and place them on a parchment paper.*

**You can roll these in coconut or chocolate sprinkles and serve them just like that if you prefer.**

*If you're coating the rum ball truffles in chocolate - you can melt candy coating wafers or temper the chocolate according to the following directions.*

**Pour half of the chocolate on a cool marble slate or kitchen counter top and roll each of the rum balls in the melted chocolate OR dip the truffles in the melted chocolate.**

*Shake off the excess gently and place them back on the parchment paper.*

**Before the chocolate coating sets - sprinkle some nuts, coconut or sprinkles. Or drizzle some white chocolate once it sets.**

*Serve at room temperature or cold. **Enjoy!***

**You can store these in the fridge for at least a week in an airtight container.**
